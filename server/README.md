Don't forget to:

1) Go to /server folder
2) do `npm install`
3) Add a file called `.env` with these environment variables:

~~~~
DBURL=mongodb://localhost:27017/reactAuthentication  
PORT=3010
~~~~

Then run the server via `npm run dev`

All trip API endpoints must be created by you in the file `server/routes/travels.js`
